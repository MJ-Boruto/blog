    "# Why this course?\n",
    "Computer network is an essential **enabling technology** to help users to develop network based applications that can **reach everywhere instantly**.\n",
    "An MIS student (as an architect, and a designer) need to be familiar with **the underlying technologies** and their **design rationale**. Hence, we can develop network applications with **a more appropriate, reasonable, and robust design**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And more, help your parents to deal with home network problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Desired Outcomes\n",
    "- They know the most common **design** in the current computer network.\n",
    "- They understand what **hardware** or **software** should be used in a complex computer network.\n",
    "- They can analyze the **performance** of a protocol, both theoretically and experimentally.\n",
    "- They can recognize the **trade-offs** between different protocol designs.\n",
    "- They can write **socket programs** with network libraries.\n",
    "- They have experience **working with network devices**.\n",
    "- They can **manage** a complex enterprise network.\n",
    "- They can **monitor** the network packet and analyze them.\n",
    "- They can identify **network security problems** and solve them."
