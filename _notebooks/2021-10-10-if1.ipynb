    "# Typical Reasons Why MNCs expand internationally\n",
    "Multinational corporations can capitalize on comparative advantages (such as a technology or cost of labor) that they have relative to firms in other countries, which allows them to penetrate those other countries’ markets. Given a world of imperfect markets, comparative advantages across countries are not freely transferable. Therefore, MNCs may be able to capitalize on comparative advantages. Many MNCs initially penetrate markets by exporting but ultimately establish a subsidiary in foreign markets and attempt to differentiate their products as other firms enter those markets (product cycle theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Economic or Political Conditions\n",
    "> why unfavorable economic or political conditions affect the MNC’s cash flows, required rate of return, and valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak economic conditions or unstable political conditions in a foreign country can reduce cash flows received by the MNC, or they can result in a higher required rate of return for the MNC. Either of these effects results in a lower valuation of the MNC.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Risks Faced by MNCs that expand internationally\n",
    "- First, there is the risk of poor economic conditions in the foreign country.\n",
    "- Second, there is country risk, which reflects the risk of changing government or public attitudes toward the MNC.\n",
    "- Third, there is exchange rate risk, which can affect the performance of the MNC in the foreign country."
